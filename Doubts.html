        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India,
        Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the
        bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he
        was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa
        in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live
        in South Africa for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised
        a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for
        civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about
        organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against
        excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian
        National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing
        poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity,
        ending untouchability, and above all for achieving swaraj or self-rule
