HTML = Static document
CSS = Add Style in the Staic document

Bootstrap = HTML + CSS + JS => PREDEFINED
JS = ???

Why Javascript ??
    => To make the static HTML content more dynamic.
    => To make Interactive User Interface.
    => To provide a best User Experience.

Why Dynamic ??
    Lets consider you have a Ecommerce website
        a) Flipkart => Browse and Select the items
        b) XYZ => Voice Based.
    Out of 10. 9 opted for option 2 i.e. Dynamic.......

What is Javascript ???
    => It is a programming language.
    => We write the program which will implement dynamic nature to your web pages.
    => Dynamic Nature ===== Behaviour of your HTML Elements.

Where we can use JS in the HTML document using the following ELement <script>JS</script>
    => you can use it inside your head tag  //css
    => you can use it inside your body tag  //Instead of body you will use in the element Inline
    => you can use the Js in a separate JS file.    //css
    => you can use it inside the html tag

Comments
    ==> // This is comment in JS
    ==> /* */ This is the comment in CSS
    ==> <!-- --> This is the comment in HTML

JS is a case sensitive language

Computers => input, processing, output.....
          => The computer does not know anything. A program tells the computer how to 
          process the input and generate a ouput for that.
          => you write a program using a programming language

          you will tell the computer what kind of data using a concept called as
          Variables.

JS Variables
    var => you can redeclare the same variable and change the value again and again
        => accessed at a global level.
    let => you cannot redeclare the same variable again but you can change the value.
        => Both local and global level is allowed depending upon the Situation.
    const => you cannot redeclare or you cannot change the value...

JS Datatypes
    => Number
    => String
    => Object
    => Booleans
    => Arrays
    => undefined

typeof => It is used to get the datatype detail form your Javascript compiler

Operators

1) Arithmetic Operators     +       -       /       *       %       **      ++      --      

2) Assignment Operators     =       +=      -=      *=      /=      %=      **=

3) Comparision Operators    ==      !=      >       <       >=      <=      ?

4) Logical Operators        &&      ||      !(&&)       !(||)

5) Bitwise Operators        &       |       ~       ^       <<      >>

A       B      A&B     A|B     ~A       A^B
0       0       0       0       1        0
0       1       0       1       1        1
1       0       0       1       0        1
1       1       1       1       0        0

0 or 1 are called a Bit

<<      >>

7   =>  0111
7<<2    =>  0111    =>  1100

7>>2    =>  0111    =>  0001

8   =>  1000
7&8 =>  0000    =>      0

<h1>Hello</h1>          => HTML Elements     => opening tag + clsing tag + content

JS Arrays
    =>  To store multiple values of same data type in a single variable.
    =>  syntax
        Method 1
            var abc = [value1,value2,value3];
            Number Arrays   =>      var abc = [1,2,3,4,5];
            String Arrays   =>      var abc = ["apple","orange","banana"];
        Method 2
            Number Arrays   =>      var abc = new Array(1,2,3,4,5);
            String Arrays   =>      var abc = new Array("apple","orange","banana");

            //OOPs - Object Oriented programming
                Array is a class
                the new keyword is used to create a object for the class Array
                abc is the created object

Index and Length
var abc = [1,2,3,4,5];
Length => 5
       => It starts from 1.
Index => position of the value inside the Array
      => The position inside the array always starts with 0.
Size  => Each int occupies 4 bytes of memory space and hence 4bytes*5   = 20 Bytes 
         [1 byte = 8 bits]

JS is also Object Oriented.

JS Loops
=> It is used to execute some statements more than once until certain condition is reached.
Types of JS Loops

1) for  => It is a loop which will execute certain statements for a fixed number of times.
        =>syntax
            for(parameter1;parameter2;parameter3)
            {
                //certain statements
            }
            parameter1  => Initialize the variable with the number
            parameter2  => Some condition, When these condition satisfies it will go to next
                           step if not then it will run the loop again.
            parameter3  => Increment => It will keep a count of how many times
                           the loop has executed

2) for in

3) for of

4) while

5) do while


<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
Array
for
=> Using the for loop i will access one item at a time, Each item i will pass It
as a list inside my Ul tag

17/Jul/2021

=> Java Objects
Real world entities = Objects
    Eg: car, bike, computer, etc....

Computer is a object. This object will have properties and Methods.
Popertiers => Ram Size, Monitor Size, Keyboard size, Mouse Type, etc....
Method => Start, Stop, Restart, Sleep, etc..

var abc = [4gb, 8gb, 102, laser]

Object are also variables. store the data in the form as key: value
or properties: value

var computer = {ram_size: "4gb", monitor_size: "16inch", .............}

To access the value the syntax is as follow:
    => Object.key

For in => is a type of loop which is used to iterate over a object.
iterate => fetchging the items one by one.

For in => It will iterate [going through the item one by one] the object
    the item in object is => properties: value

    for x in object =>  item by item will be accessed.
        object[x] => you are accesing the value stored inside that item

Strings
=> is defined as Collection of characters.

    => It is like a array of characters.
    => In string the same concept as array follows:
    => index, size and length.

    => In array 
    from left hand side, the index starts from 0
    from right hand side, the index will start from -1

=> are also used for Storing the characters.
=> are used for performing some action on a characters.
=> The string can contain 0 or more characters.
=> syntax:
    var abc = "";   //empty string
    var abc = "Raghu"   //string
=> you can also use a single quote to declare a string.
    var abc = 'Raghu';

=> "       ''          "
=> '       ""          '

String MEthods:
1) length
2) COncatenation => joins or merges more than one string together.
                    It uses a + Operator to merge.

3) slice        => Both left and right approach can be used.
4) substring    => similar to your slice operator. WIll not accept
                    the negative index value. Only the left approach can 
                    be used.
5) replace => You can replace a character or a group of characters.
           => It will replace and create a new string.
           => It will replace only the first encountered value.

    //Homework
6) trim => remove all the extra spaces
7) uppercase => the string will be printed in uppercase
8) lowwercase => the string will be printed in lowercase.

JS Math
=> Inbuilt constant values example: Math.PI, Math.E,Math.LN2, etc...
=> round
=> ceil
=> floor
=> pow
=> sqrt
=> max
=> min 
=> random
    //Homework
=> sin, cos, tan, log
