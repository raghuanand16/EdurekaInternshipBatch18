10-July2021 - Javascript

HTML = Static document
CSS = Add Style in the Staic document

Bootstrap = HTML + CSS + JS => PREDEFINED
JS = ???

Why Javascript ??
    => To make the static HTML content more dynamic.
    => To make Interactive User Interface.
    => To provide a best User Experience.

Why Dynamic ??
    Lets consider you have a Ecommerce website
        a) Flipkart => Browse and Select the items
        b) XYZ => Voice Based.
    Out of 10. 9 opted for option 2 i.e. Dynamic.......

What is Javascript ???
    => It is a programming language.
    => We write the program which will implement dynamic nature to your web pages.
    => Dynamic Nature ===== Behaviour of your HTML Elements.

Where we can use JS in the HTML document using the following ELement <script>JS</script>
    => you can use it inside your head tag  //css
    => you can use it inside your body tag  //Instead of body you will use in the element Inline
    => you can use the Js in a separate JS file.    //css
    => you can use it inside the html tag

Comments
    ==> // This is comment in JS
    ==> /* */ This is the comment in CSS
    ==> <!-- --> This is the comment in HTML

JS is a case sensitive language

Computers => input, processing, output.....
          => The computer does not know anything. A program tells the computer how to 
          process the input and generate a ouput for that.
          => you write a program using a programming language

          you will tell the computer what kind of data using a concept called as
          Variables.

JS Variables
    var => you can redeclare the same variable and change the value again and again
        => accessed at a global level.
    let => you cannot redeclare the same variable again but you can change the value.
        => Both local and global level is allowed depending upon the Situation.
    const => you cannot redeclare or you cannot change the value...

JS Datatypes
    => Number
    => String
    => Object
    => Booleans
    => Arrays
    => undefined

typeof => It is used to get the datatype detail form your Javascript compiler

Operators

1) Arithmetic Operators     +       -       /       *       %       **      ++      --      

2) Assignment Operators     =       +=      -=      *=      /=      %=      **=

3) Comparision Operators    ==      !=      >       <       >=      <=      ?

4) Logical Operators        &&      ||      !(&&)       !(||)

5) Bitwise Operators        &       |       ~       ^       <<      >>

A       B      A&B     A|B     ~A       A^B
0       0       0       0       1        0
0       1       0       1       1        1
1       0       0       1       0        1
1       1       1       1       0        0

0 or 1 are called a Bit

<<      >>

7   =>  0111
7<<2    =>  0111    =>  1100

7>>2    =>  0111    =>  0001

8   =>  1000
7&8 =>  0000    =>      0

<h1>Hello</h1>          => HTML Elements     => opening tag + clsing tag + content

JS Arrays
    =>  To store multiple values of same data type in a single variable.
    =>  syntax
        Method 1
            var abc = [value1,value2,value3];
            Number Arrays   =>      var abc = [1,2,3,4,5];
            String Arrays   =>      var abc = ["apple","orange","banana"];
        Method 2
            Number Arrays   =>      var abc = new Array(1,2,3,4,5);
            String Arrays   =>      var abc = new Array("apple","orange","banana");

            //OOPs - Object Oriented programming
                Array is a class
                the new keyword is used to create a object for the class Array
                abc is the created object

Index and Length
var abc = [1,2,3,4,5];
Length => 5
       => It starts from 1.
Index => position of the value inside the Array
      => The position inside the array always starts with 0.
Size  => Each int occupies 4 bytes of memory space and hence 4bytes*5   = 20 Bytes 
         [1 byte = 8 bits]

JS is also Object Oriented.

JS Loops
=> It is used to execute some statements more than once until certain condition is reached.
Types of JS Loops

1) for  => It is a loop which will execute certain statements for a fixed number of times.
        =>syntax
            for(parameter1;parameter2;parameter3)
            {
                //certain statements
            }
            parameter1  => Initialize the variable with the number
            parameter2  => Some condition, When these condition satisfies it will go to next
                           step if not then it will run the loop again.
            parameter3  => Increment => It will keep a count of how many times
                           the loop has executed

2) for in

3) for of - Not a part of Agenda.

4) while

5) do while


<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
Array
for
=> Using the for loop i will access one item at a time, Each item i will pass It
as a list inside my Ul tag

17/Jul/2021

=> Java Objects
Real world entities = Objects
    Eg: car, bike, computer, etc....

Computer is a object. This object will have properties and Methods.
Popertiers => Ram Size, Monitor Size, Keyboard size, Mouse Type, etc....
Method => Start, Stop, Restart, Sleep, etc..

var abc = [4gb, 8gb, 102, laser]

Object are also variables. store the data in the form as key: value
or properties: value

var computer = {ram_size: "4gb", monitor_size: "16inch", .............}

To access the value the syntax is as follow:
    => Object.key

For in => is a type of loop which is used to iterate over a object.
iterate => fetchging the items one by one.

For in => It will iterate [going through the item one by one] the object
    the item in object is => properties: value

    for x in object =>  item by item will be accessed.
        object[x] => you are accesing the value stored inside that item

Strings
=> is defined as Collection of characters.

    => It is like a array of characters.
    => In string the same concept as array follows:
    => index, size and length.

    => In array 
    from left hand side, the index starts from 0
    from right hand side, the index will start from -1

=> are also used for Storing the characters.
=> are used for performing some action on a characters.
=> The string can contain 0 or more characters.
=> syntax:
    var abc = "";   //empty string
    var abc = "Raghu"   //string
=> you can also use a single quote to declare a string.
    var abc = 'Raghu';

=> "       ''          "
=> '       ""          '

String MEthods:
1) length
2) COncatenation => joins or merges more than one string together.
                    It uses a + Operator to merge.

3) slice        => Both left and right approach can be used.
4) substring    => similar to your slice operator. WIll not accept
                    the negative index value. Only the left approach can 
                    be used.
5) replace => You can replace a character or a group of characters.
           => It will replace and create a new string.
           => It will replace only the first encountered value.

    //Homework
6) trim => remove all the extra spaces
7) uppercase => the string will be printed in uppercase
8) lowwercase => the string will be printed in lowercase.

JS Math
=> Inbuilt constant values example: Math.PI, Math.E,Math.LN2, etc...
=> round
=> ceil
=> floor
=> pow
=> sqrt
=> max
=> min 
=> random
    //Homework
=> sin, cos, tan, log

18/Jul/2021

JS Date 
    => Year, Month, Day, Hours, Minutes, Seconds and MilliSeconds.

    => Month always starts from 0 to 11, 0 being Jan.
    => For Custom Date
let d2 = new Date(year, month, day, hour, min, second, milliseconds);

JS Form Validation and Functions.
=> It is a process to check whether the given data is appropriate or not.
=> Yes, the server was initially handling it.

=> First Name   =   10
=> Last Name    =   10
=> User Id Field    5
=> Password Field   8
=> Phone Number Field   10

Hw:
=> Address Field    30
=> City Field       20
=> Pincode Field    6
=> State Field      20
=> Checkbox - Tick if you agree to our terms and conditions.

Exception handling
=> It is a concept which is used to handle the exception(errors).
=> It is achieved with the help of 4 keywords, namely:
    1) try => you write the statements which may generate a error.
    2) catch => Whenever the try statement encounters a error then that
                error is handled by the catch statement.
    3) throw => It is used to throw error from one part of your program
                to another. It also lets you create your own custom errors.
    4) finally => Whether the try statement encounters a error or not, the
                  finally statments will just execute.
    //pseudo code
    try{
        //statements;
    }
    catch(error){
        statements;
        throw error
    }
    finally{
        //statments;
    }

20/Jul/2021

POst all the questions.
I will be ansering them one by one.

1) can you pls explain the "forEach" loop
=> This is a method in JS,  It will access one 
item at a time from the array.
=> I will access from the beginning and stops at end.

var arr123 = [10,20,30,40];
arr123.forEach(fun123);
var text = ""
fun123(item, index){
    text += item + "<br/>";
}

for(initialization, condition, increment)   => developer
initialization = starting point in the array
condition => ending point in the array
move from starting point to ending point

10
20
30
40

2) sir please explain form validation again??

=> validation = to check whether the user has sent 
appropriate data as per the exceptation of the server.
=> Eg:- Server is expecting a password.[1 U, 1 L, 1 N,
1 Special character, minimum 8 digits maximam - 16 digits]

<form name="myform">
input type="password" name="mypassword"
</form>

ksjfguisd!12        => upper case is missing.

We implement some code in js to check all these pre
conditions.....

var abc = document.forms[myform][mypassword].value ;
abc = ksjfguisd!12;
if(abc.length >= 8 && abc.length <=16)
{
    document.getelemetnbyid("abc").innerHTML = "It is false";
}
let x
for (x in abc){
    //characters from the string one by one.

}

3) what is a callback function and closure?

4) can u please tell about method="POST/GET"?
=> get method => HTTP Protocol.
=> client and server is trying to communicate.
=> post

Information:
Round will give the value of nearest integer 
but ceil will give the nearest value greater 
than the given number

Is JS code is valid for one page or it has no limit?
No limit.

What is COncatenation ??
=> Merging 2 or more strings together.
Method 1
    +
Method 2 
    Strcat(str1,str2)


item and index are variable or parameters
We pass them as Paramters but inbuilt variables.

sir when we create the websites hsing html and css  
what javascript will doing in websites when we used 
=> Yes you can create websites using html and css
    But these websites will be static in nature. Fixed.

But if you use JS => login, signup, contact you....

Can you please explain JS math?
=> Its a class which has some methods which are related to mathematical
operators.

math.max        => 5
math.random     => 0 to 1 => 0.56466874 *4 => <4
math.min(1,2,3,4,5) => 1

var abc = "Hello I am in India";
str.substring(0,5)  => Hello


22/Jul/2021

Session id and Cookies.
Unique Key.

=> Database at the back end.

sir you told that in dice, Math.floor(Math.random() * 7); but it 
will also give 0,then i think we should use Math.ceil(Math.random() * 6)
=>  1 to 6


can you explain, for in loop
THese actually accesses the properties of a object.
It will acees the Key: Value pair one by one.
Value is passed back.

var abc = {empid:"001", name:"raghu"}
for (x in abc)      // x => empid: "001"    // x => name
{
    abc[name]
}

will you be explain the whole concept of payment gateway integration
Yes if we have time.

var abc = " Hey i am from India     ";
abc.trim();

// Hey i am from India

Convert the data from one format to another.....
these white spaces will be carried out. to eliminate them we use the trim 
function.

what is mean by json what is the use of it
Java script object notation

It is just a data format

in starting when we login OTP verification is necessary. 
Then how it is possible.

hoisting in let and var
Behaviour in which you can declare the variable
var x = [1,2,3,4]
x.length;


what is type casting

+ => unary operator => convert a string into a number.
var y = "10";
var abc = +y;

parseInt

It is going to parse a string and returns a integer

Obj1.M1(P1)
obj2.M2
Obj3.M1(P2)
